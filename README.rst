Camera Control
==============

`Camera Control <https://github.com/fmorgner/camera-control.git>`_ is a simple firmware for `Microchip ATmega32U4 <https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32U4>`_ MCUs, to control digital cameras via the `Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Transfer_Protocol>`_.
Development occurs mainly based on the `Arduino Leonardo <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Arduino_BoardLeonardo>`_ development board using the (retired) *USB Host Shield* by *Circuits@Home*.
This firmware serves mainly as a playground for the development of a modern C++ interface to AVR 8-bit MCUs.
